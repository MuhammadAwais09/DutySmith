WITH EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE CHATBOT USING MACHINE LEARNING" (pasted_content.txt)
. Overall Description
. Product Perspective
The system is a new, standalone product that will replace existing manual or disparate
systems for HR and duty management. It is designed as an integrated ecosystem where the
administrative functions and the employee assistance functions share a single,
authoritative data source.
. Product Functions
The primary functions of the system are to:
• Automate staff appointment and duty scheduling via an intuitive admin portal.
• Maintain accurate, centralized records of employee data, leave, attendance, and shift
information.
• Provide instant, personalized information access to employees through a
conversational chatbot interface.
• Improve communication efficiency and reduce the administrative workload on HR staff.

. General Constraints
• Technology Stack: The system must be developed using the following specific
technologies:
• Frontend (Web): HTML, CSS, JS, or a modern framework (e.g., React/Angular)
interacting with the Flask Backend.
• Mobile App: Flutter (Dart).
• Backend: Python with Flask (for Admin Portal and ML/NLP API endpoints).
• Database: Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore (NoSQL structure).
• Machine Learning: Libraries such as scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, or TensorFlow
(Integrated with the Flask Backend).
• Integration: All components must integrate seamlessly via REST APIs and the Firebase
database.
• Performance: Chatbot responses must be near real-time to ensure a positive user
experience.
. Assumptions and Dependencies
• Data Integrity: It is assumed that administrators will input and maintain accurate data
in the Admin Portal.
• API Stability: The system is dependent on stable API communication between the Flask
backend, Firebase, and the ML/NLP Engine.
• ML Model Training: The ML model for Intent Detection and Entity Extraction will
require an initial dataset for training and continuous refinement.

Allow employees to Submit
leave requests digitally,
specifying dates and type of
leave.
FR-E. Receive Notifications
Provide real-time updates
about leave approvals, duty
changes, or other system
alerts, leveraging Firebase
Cloud Messaging (FCM).
FR-E. Chatbot Access
Provide a dedicated interface

Employee Assistance
Chatbot using natural
language queries.
.. Chatbot Module Requirements (ML Component)
ID Sub-Module Description
FR-C. NLP Preprocessing
The system must tokenize
and clean raw user query text
before processing.
FR-C. Intent Detection
An ML model must accurately
classify the user's intent (e.g.,
CheckLeaveBalance ,
GetDutySchedule ,
ShowAttendance ).
FR-C. Entity Extraction
The system must identify key
entities within the query
(e.g., date ranges, "my shift")
to parameterize database
queries.
FR-C. Database Querying
The system must map the
detected intent and entities
to a secure Firebase query

. System Architecture and Flow Diagram
. System Components
The system is composed of four main, interconnected components:
. Admin Web Portal (Flask/Web Frontend): The management interface.
. Employee Mobile App (Flutter): The user-facing application, including the Chatbot
Interface.
. Central Database (Firebase): The single source of truth for all employee, duty, and
record data.
. ML/NLP Engine (Flask Endpoint): The service responsible for processing natural
language queries and generating responses.
. Core Database Collections/Nodes (Firebase)
The Central Database (Firebase) will include, but not be limited to, the following core
Collections/Nodes (structured as a NoSQL database):
Collection/Node Key Fields Description
Employee
uid (Firebase Auth ID),
name , department ,
shift_preference
Core employee information
and authentication details.
Appointment/Duty
duty_id , emp_id , date ,
time_start , time_end ,
description
Records of assigned duties or
appointments.
Attendance
attendance_id , emp_id , date ,
status
Daily presence or absence
records.
Leave
leave_id , emp_id , start_date ,
end_date , status ,
remaining_leaves
Stores leave applications and
current leave balances.
Notification
notif_id , emp_id , message ,
date_time
Alerts for updates and
approvals.
. System Flow Diagram
The following diagram illustrates the high-level interaction and data flow between the
system's main components, highlighting the separate workflows for administration, general
employee use, and the intelligent chatbot interaction.
Workflow Description:
. Admin Workflow: The Admin Web Portal (Flask) manages all core data (Employee,
Duty, Leave) by writing to and reading from the Central Database (Firebase).
. Employee Workflow: The Employee Mobile App (Flutter) allows employees to view
their schedules and apply for leave, with data flowing directly to and from the Central
Database (Firebase).
. Chatbot Workflow:
• An employee submits a natural language query via the Chatbot Interface.
• The query is routed to the ML/NLP Engine (Flask) for Intent/Entity Detection.
• The engine translates the intent into a Firebase Query.
• The Central Database (Firebase) returns the result to the ML/NLP Engine.
• The engine generates a Natural Language Response and sends it back to the
employee.
. Synchronization: The Central Database (Firebase) acts as the single point of truth,
ensuring that any updates made by the Admin Portal are instantly reflected in the data
retrieved by the Employee App and the Chatbot.
. Future Enhancements
The following features are considered out of scope for the initial release (Version .) but
are planned for future development:
• Enable voice interaction with the chatbot.
• Integrate predictive analytics for staff workload distribution.
• Implement multi-language support for diverse staff members.
• Allow the chatbot to initiate actions (e.g., leave application, duty change requests)
rather than just providing information.
